# News Ninja ðŸ¥·ðŸ“°

The News Ninja (Fake News Detection) is a machine learning-based initiative aimed at identifying and classifying news articles as either true or fake. With the proliferation of misinformation and disinformation on the internet, the project seeks to provide a reliable tool for users to distinguish between trustworthy and unreliable news sources.

# Features
* Data Collection: A diverse dataset of news articles labeled as real or fake is collected from various sources for training and evaluation purposes.

* Preprocessing: The textual data undergoes preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal to prepare it for analysis.

* Machine Learning Models: Supervised machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier are trained using the labeled dataset to classify news articles as true or fake.

* Model Evaluation: The performance of the machine learning models is assessed using metrics like support, precision, recall, and F1-score.

* Deployment: The trained model can be used with texts from different web-pages, where users can submit news articles for analysis and receive instant feedback on their authenticity.

* Continuous Improvement: The project is continually refined and updated based on user feedback, new data sources, and emerging techniques in natural language processing and machine learning.
